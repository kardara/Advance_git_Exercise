## Challenge 1: Missing File Fix

1. **Check the current repository status**  
   Run the following command to see the current state of the repository:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   Output:
   ```bash
   On branch master
   Your branch is based on 'origin/master', but the upstream is gone.
     (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

   Untracked files:
     (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

           README.md
           test4.md

   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
   ```

2. **Stage the missing file**  
   To stage the missing file (`test4.md`), use the following command:

   ```bash
   git add test4.md
   ```

3. **Amend the last commit**  
   Now, amend the previous commit to include the missing file:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "Add missing test4.md file"
   ```

   Output:
   ```bash
   [master 4fd309f] Add missing test4.md file
    Date: Wed Feb 26 11:12:37 2025 +0200
    2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 test3.md
    create mode 100644 test4.md
   ```
